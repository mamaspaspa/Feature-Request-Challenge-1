# Horiseon Homepage Feature Request Challenge

## Description
This repo is for my first weekly challenge, editing the provided code to make it cleaner and so that it follows accessibility standards. By optimising the code for this 'company', their site will be better optimized for search engines. In this challenge, studied and applied: Alt tags, semantic elements, condensing HTML and CSS code wherever possible and slightly editing the colours of the site to be more appealing.
